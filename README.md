# argo-overlay

I have made these repositories public for use in reproducing. To do this yourself, clone this code and create a private repository that you own.

Point an argo application at the `dev` folder and update the `kustomization.yaml` to point at your own private repository.

The `argo-manifest-updates` outlines what I needed to change in a default argo install to get this working with my fork.
